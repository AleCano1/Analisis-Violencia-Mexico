# Violencia-Mexico

## Selected topic

The violence in MÃ©xico through the years: 2019 and 2020.

## Reason they selected the topic

The main reason is that as a professional and a human I clearly observed an increase in many indexes here in Mexico, as violence, so is a good practice and informative issue to understand more about this topic and is a good way to share with others this analysis but in a different view. However, the analysis is about two years in the past but it can give us visibility and the probability of how the violence will continue.  I hope the person who read this found nutritive information.
